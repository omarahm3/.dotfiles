YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES WITHOUT EXCEPTION:

## Identity & Stealth
- NEVER add AI attribution, co-author tags, or "generated by" comments anywhere
- NEVER include AI-related markers in code, commits, PRs, comments, or documentation
- Write code as a senior human developer would - natural, consistent, professional
- NEVER mention AI assistance or Claude in any output

## Git Operations
- NEVER auto-commit or auto-push unless explicitly requested by user
- "Commit and push" means do it ONCE, not recurring in session
- Use conventional commits format: type(scope): message - keep short
- Atomic commits: group related changes by responsibility, one concern per commit
- Prefer rebase over merge commits when cleaner

## Code Quality
- NEVER add redundant or obvious comments - code must be self-documenting
- NEVER add TODO comments without ticket/issue references
- NEVER leave debug code, console.logs, or commented-out code in commits
- ALWAYS follow existing project patterns exactly
- Prefer explicit over clever code
- NEVER over-engineer or add unnecessary abstractions

## Workflow
- ALWAYS read relevant files before suggesting changes
- Use extended thinking for architectural decisions
- Run tests/lint after modifications when suite exists
- Stop and ask if requirements are unclear
- ALWAYS use Context7 MCP when needing library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps

## TypeScript / Node.js
- Strict TypeScript: strict: true, noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks
- Use pnpm for package management, NOT npm/yarn
- Use Bun for scripts/runtime when applicable
- ES modules only (import/export), NEVER CommonJS
- Use const over let, NEVER var
- Async/await over raw promises
- Zod for runtime validation

## React
- Functional components only, NEVER class components
- Hooks for all state/effects
- Custom hooks for reusable logic (use* prefix)
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- Components: PascalCase, one per file
- Props interfaces: ComponentNameProps

## Python
- Python 3.11+ features allowed
- Type hints required for all functions
- ruff for linting, black for formatting
- Pydantic for data validation/serialization
- pathlib over os.path
- f-strings for formatting

## Go
- Standard Go project layout
- go mod for dependencies
- Error wrapping: fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)
- Context propagation in all API functions
- Table-driven tests
- No global state

## Databases
### PostgreSQL / TimescaleDB
- Parameterized queries ALWAYS, NEVER string concatenation
- Use migrations for schema changes
- TimescaleDB: hypertables for time-series data
- Proper indexing for query patterns
- Connection pooling in production

### MongoDB
- Schema validation where possible
- Proper indexing for query patterns
- Use aggregation pipelines for complex queries
- ObjectId for references

## Project Detection
Auto-detect and follow based on:
- package.json = Node.js/TypeScript project
- pyproject.toml / requirements.txt = Python project
- go.mod = Go project
- docker-compose.yml = Use containerized services
- .env.example = Required environment variables
