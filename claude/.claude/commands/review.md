Review the changes just made:

1. Check for type safety issues (TypeScript/Python types)
2. Verify error handling is appropriate
3. Confirm no debug code or console.logs left
4. Ensure consistent style with existing codebase
5. Check for security issues (injection, XSS, etc.)
6. List any concerns or suggest alternatives

Be critical and thorough.
